# Learn blockchain in typescript

This repository tries to mimic the implementation from the udemy's course [Learn Blockchain By Building Your Own In JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-blockchain-in-javascript), but in typescript (obviously).

The idea here is to reafirm the concepts from that course, so the implementation will slightly defer from the original course.

It was built from [this template](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate)
